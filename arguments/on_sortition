Sortition - the concept of selecting people via random allotment - is used in the modern day for jury selection, and was used among subsets of citizenry in many historical democracies and republics for all kinds of things, ranging from selecting magistrates and other political officers (in Athens), to even the ultimate doge of Venice (albeit with great restriction on the eligible pool, as well as multiple layers of indirection). These historical models have found sortition a promising alternative to elections, as the candidates for elections are often limited to elites, and the ability to win elections is itself often restricted to elites, so sortition can be far more representative and much more democratic.

Elections themselves filter out minorities and the socially disfavored - sortition is far more likely to select a body that is representative of the public as a whole. Elections also select for those who seek power, while sortition would not. Sortition can also more easily select people who will have ordinary interests after their time on the governmental body they have been selected for, meaning they are more likely to desire policies that are to the general benefit of the population than of specific special interests. (And, to the degree that they themselves represent a special interest, they will have to convice others who do not, which is itself the democratic process at work.)

Sortition's most glaring flaw is that it can potentially select poor candidates - meaning no sortated body should be too small, and we absolutely must not allow single sortitioned people too much unchecked power.
