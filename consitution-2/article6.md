The judicial branch is to oversee cases and controversies brought against individuals or the government for violating the law or rights.
Appointments to the judiciary are to be done by the legislature with the advice and consent of the Senate, though if a judicial position remains open for more than six months, that position's colleagues are to nominate a judge for the Senate to confirm, and a judge appointed in such a way shall suffer no deficiency from that appointment.
The judiciary can and should always hear novel or necessary challenges to any law or doctrine that is alleged to violate any clause of Article 2, if such is necessary to prevent it from evading review.
Appointment as a standard judge shall be for life and good behavior, and the judiciary should specify an ethical code that includes what transgressions are impeachable. Positions on courts of appeals shall be held by judges in good standing who are selected by their colleagues for a limited term, at the end of which they will revert to their previous appointment.

-----------------

Judiciary! Lifetime appointments via the legislature, but the appeals courts are selected by judges since independence. but also, a rule saying "yes judges can consider nonsense that's trying to evade review". also, if the legislature is shitting the bed on appointments, let the jusiciary sort it out - the legislature should be in charge if it can, but if it's too divided, the judiciary should not grind to a halt.
