Preamble:
The purpose of the government is to ensure prosperity, freedom, equality, and security for all inhabitants of the polity. To this end, it is granted powers by the citizenry, and with those powes come obligations.
To ensure the populace has the ability to compel the government to fulfill its obligations, the rights in this Article are explicitly recognized and enforcable against the government, but are not exhaustive, and failure to be listed here does not preclude a right from being recognized by the government.

Commentary: This takes the natural rights framework as a given, uses the EU declaration of human rights as a model, steals a few things from the US constitution that the EUHCR doesn't address (or will when I transplant them from draft 1), and generally is just a big list of rights because governments generally won't give people rights unless they're spelled out in black and white... or blood.
The core tradeoff of governance goals is also mentioned as justification for the powers and testrictions, though that will be revisited again.
This is the second Article because it's more foundational than the actual structure of government; government is for and by the people, so we must start with the people. (the eventual order of the articles will be: The Constitution Itself, The People, The Parliament, The Senate, The Courts.
