Section 1:
The government of a polity deriving its power from the consent of the governed, this constitution is to allow amendment by a true majority of all eligible voters of the polity; should a voter fail to vote upon an amendment, that is equivalent to rejection of an amendment.
The government may place laws and regulations around the amendment process so long as they do not meaningfully hinder the adoption of any amendment which is capable of achieving such a true majority.

Section 2:
Citizenship within the polity is to be granted to all who dwell within the polity at the time of the adoption of this constitution, all who are born within the polity subsequently, any children of citizens who intend to reside within the polity as of the age of maturity, and any who reside in territory that is permanently added to the polity at the time such territory is added.
Citizenship within the polity can only be removed with the explicit uncoerced consent of the ex-citizen and only if they no longer reside within the polity as of the time of such removal.
The government may and should provide additional paths for the acquisition of citizenship.


Commentary:
Reasonable signature requirements for a proposed amendment to get onto a ballot are fine (as failure to achieve such requirements would be a sign that a majority cannot be reached), requiring an amendment to be voted on at the next ordinary election so as to minimize disruptive overhead to vote counting is fine (as such would also be expected to improve the odds of passage), and the legislature can propose amendments themselves, that's fine too.

As for citizenship: born in the territory? citizen. born overseas to citizens who aren't permanent emigrants from the polity? citizen. Live in newly-acquired territory? Citizen. Revocation is to be only available for people who want to free themselves from the obligations of citizenship but who also are citizens elsewhere - recognize that a pathway may be desired but it should not be available to the government as a tool.
Naturalized citizens are also citizens, but there's room to make rules and laws about it (though I would leave those paths wide open.)
