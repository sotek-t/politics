The Senate is to serve as the voice of the people; it is to consist of a randomly selected cross-section of the body politic. It is granted powers of oversight, confirmation, and to serve as the jury in impeachment proceedings.
The Senate is to consist of one hundred and one Senators with voting powers, and any number of Senator-Emeriti without voting powers. A Senatorial term lasts for five years as of the point of selection. Senatorial selection is to be performed by public, fair, random process.
Once a Senator-select acknowledges and accepts their selection, they become a Senator in truth, and only the Senate can remove their oversight privileges. They may reject the selection at the time if they so wish.
If a Senator-select cannot be contacted within a month of their selection, their selection is void and a new Senator is to be selected.
When a Senator's term expires (5 years to the day after their acceptance of the position), they become a Senator-Emeritus, retain Senatorial oversight powers, but no longer have a binding vote in the Senate.
Senators and Senator-Emeriti are to be paid a salary such that their wages are at least as much as 75% of the population; the only special tax that may be placed on this wage is a tax capped at the value of whatever other income they may have.
Oversight privileges can be stripped from a Senator or Senator-Emeritus via vote of the Senate, but only an impeachment can remove their salary or vote (if a regular Senator).
Voting in the Senate must be performed via secret ballot; Senators are permitted to discuss their vote but attenpts to prove it outside of the trivial (known absentee, unanimous) or formal allegations of fraud in the count are to be considered bribery and thus should lead to impeachment.
Nothing is permitted to restrict the access of a voting Senator from scheduled sessions of the Senate unless the Senate as a whole grants permission ahead of time, though such permission must be reversible.

This version is a poorly-drafted mess, but:
- I figure that law can specify the process for selecting senators, but what I envision as a possibility is that everyone has a unique-for-a-time-period (per election cycle, likely) ID number that is not trivial for the public to map to a person but is easy enough to show are generally unique (both one-number-per-person and one-person-per-number), and senatorial selection is performed via a recorded-and-livestreamed usage of one of those lottery ball machines where they pull balls to generate a number the same length as a voter ID number, and if it matches they're a senator, and if not, they re-pull. (the first ball can be limited to be from a set that only contains valid leading digits - if there's 270 million candidates with densely packed ids, the first ball pull can have only 0, 1, or 2 in the machine - but subsequent ball pulls must include the possibility of drawing balls that can lead to invalid numbers or the odds get skewed)
- The constitutional wage and Senator-emeritus role is to help insulate against bribery, including various types of 'quiet' bribery such as guaranteed post-service employment.
- ... probably need something about senatorial qualifications.
- secret ballot! Fundamentally, senators as a random cross-section of society are potentially prone to various kinds of bribery, hence mandatory ballot secrecy and the Senator-emeritus status.
- the senate is vaguely jury-inspired.
- the access clause is inspired by Speech And Debate but allows the senate to for instance mandate metal detectors. also, like, the Senate can't vote to abolish itself.
