Agencies of the Executive Branch as created by acts of the Article 3 legislative branch and helmed by people confirmed by vote of the Article 4 oversight branch have all and only those powers necessary to carry out their assigned responsibilities as consistent with the rights reserved to the populace by Article 2.
The legislature may create and abolish agencies by law, may appoint multiple officers to helm an agency either jointly or in a defined order of succession, but an agency has no power if not helmed by a Senate-confirmed individual. Should an individual be nominated to head an agency, the Senate is required to hold a vote on that nomination within 21 calendar days.

---------------------

The basic concept here is: no unitary executive, absolutely not, never. The legislature delegates powers for the sake of handling responsibilities, the Senate provides oversight, and yes, actually, the Senate can veto an agency if it proactively resists appointments hard enough (but this seems unlikely to happen for real - controversial appointees will be rejected but to abolish an agency this way implies a lot of opposition...)
